## Executive Summary: Learning Outcomes from Project #4 - Fault-Tolerant Replicated KV-Store using Paxos
1. **Understanding Paxos Algorithm:**
   Gained a deep understanding of the Paxos consensus algorithm, as proposed in Lamport's "Paxos made simple."
   Understood how the protocol ensures agreement amongst distributed processes, even in the face of failure.
2. **Enhanced Knowledge of Distributed Systems:**
   The project enhanced my understanding of distributed systems, especially the challenges and solutions related to achieving consensus across replicas.
3. **Importance of Fault Tolerance:**
   Learned why two-phase commit protocols aren't always adequate due to their lack of fault tolerance.
   By integrating Paxos, I was able to ensure continual operation of systems despite failures.
4. **Implementation of Paxos Roles:**
   Got hands-on experience in implementing and integrating various Paxos roles including Proposers, Acceptors, and Learners.
   This gave me insights into how each role functions and collaborates to achieve consensus.
5. **Handling Random Failures:**
   Incorporating random failures in the acceptors (and potentially other roles) simulates real-world challenges.
   With this I understood how to design systems to handle unforeseen circumstances, enhancing robustness and reliability.
6. **Practical Exposure to Thread Management:**
   This project offered practical exposure to managing these entities.
   If threads are used, participants will learn how to handle thread failures and restarts, crucial for simulating real-world system behaviors.
7. **Adaptability and Recovery:**
   The periodic failure and restart of threads (especially acceptors) mimic real-world system interruptions.
   This taught me how to design adaptable systems that can recover and resume operations even after unexpected terminations.
8. **Visualization of Paxos in Action:**
    As replicas communicate and work to achieve consensus, I observed the beauty and intricacy of Paxos in action.
    This solidifies the theoretical understanding gained from the Lamport papers and class discussions.
    In conclusion, this project served as a cornerstone in understanding and implementing fault-tolerant consensus algorithms in distributed systems.
